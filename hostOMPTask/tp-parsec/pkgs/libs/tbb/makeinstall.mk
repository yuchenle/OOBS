# Because TBB's top-level Makefile does not have "make install",
# include this file at the end of ./src/Makefile so that PARSEC's parsecmgmt
# can know how to install this TBB package into appropriate directories,
# e.g., "include ${PARSECDIR}/pkgs/libs/tbb/makeinstall.mk".
# This action should be taken every time a new TBB tarball is downloaded
# and extracted into ./src by tbb.mk.
